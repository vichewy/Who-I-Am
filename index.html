  <h2> Hey! The name is Victor</h2>
  <article>
    <p> I'm a new software engineer from San Diego, California.</p>
    <p> Growing up in the world of acting, I know how to do a few things, such as:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Stick my nose in scripts for hours</li> <!-- I've always loved a good double meaning -->
      <li>Review how to say each and every word with a different <em>emphasis</em></li>
      <li>Work with a lot of creative minds on a common output</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Take a look around and don't hesitate to <a href="#contact">contact me</a></p>

    <h4>About Victor</h4>
    <p> Victor worked in the film and theatre industry up until the COVID pandemic. With the work stoppage, he worked taking care of kids, and discovered a love for technology and what it can do.</p>
    <p> Victor is thankful for the <a href="#">Thinkful</a> program, as it has provided him the education and freedom to work in this field.</p>
